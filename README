PROPAGANDA:

See http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/w3mir/ for propaganda.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Where can I get a new version of w3mir?
A: The w3mir homepage is at http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/w3mir/.
   W3mir is also distributed on CPAN: http://www.perl.com/

Q: Are there any mailing lists?
A: Yes, see below.

Q: Should I subscribe to any of the mailinglists?
A: Yes, if you use w3mir at all you should subscribe to 
   w3mir-info@usit.uio.no, send e-mail to janl@math.uio.no to be
   subscribed.

Q: I found a bug!
A: See below.

Q: How do it...
A: There is a w3mir-HOWTO.html file in the distribution.  Read it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUGS:

- -lc switch does not work too well.

Please see below for how to report bugs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES (NOT bugs):

- URLs with two /es ('//') in the path component does not work
  as some might expect.  According to my reading of the http/url spec.
  it is an illegal construct, which is a Good Thing, because I don't
  know how to handle it if it's legal.
- If you start at http://foo/bar/ then index.html might be gotten twice.
- Some documents point to a point above the server root, i.e.,
  http://some.server/../stuff.html.  Netscape, and other browsers, in
  defiance of the URL standard documents will change the URL to
  http://some.server/stuff.html.  W3mir will not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIL LISTS, REPORTING BUGS:

Please send ideas (see todo lists further down please) and bug reports
to w3mir-core@usit.uio.no, please include URL and command line/config
file that triggered the bug. w3mir-info@usit.uio.no is mainly used for
announcing new versions or bugs to w3mir users. You will get more
information following that list than anywhere else. And it's very low
volume. To subscribe to these lists email janl@math.uio.no. The
w3mir-core list is intended for w3mir hackers only.

COPYRIGTHS:

w3mir, w3http.pm, w3pdfuri.pm and htmlop.pm are free but it is
Copyrighted by the various involved hackers.  If you want to copy,
hack or distribte w3mir you can do that providing you comply with the

TODO LIST:

* TODO, version 1.1:

Some of these are speculative, some others are very useful.

- CSS parsing/support at the same level as HTML
- Full support for APPLETS/OBJECT tags.
- Alias rules.  These would enable w3mir to map ukoln.bath.ac.uk and 
  bubl.bath.ac.uk to www.ukoln.ac.uk and know that the objects contained
  in these are all the same.  Another use would be to mirror from a mirror
  instead of the _real_ site, since the original site to which you have
  references are on a slow link while the mirror is on a fast link.
- FTP support (easy if through a http style ftp proxy, but is that what
  we want?)
- SHTTP/SSL support
- Add a 3rd argument to URL/Also that denotes the depth of documents to
  be retrived under each, this would autimatically generate fetch/ignore
  rules.  How well these work would be dependent on the order of the
  URL/Also directives though.  Must be documented.
- Retrive recursively until N-th order links are reached.  This
  differs siginificantly from directory recursion which we do now.  When
  this is done w3mir should also know the difference between inline and
  external links, inline links should always be retrived.  Trivia question:
  What order is needed to reach every findable document on the web from
  Yahoo?
- Integrate with cvs or rcs (or other version controll system) to make
  retriver able to reproduce mirrored site for any given date.
- Some text processing:  Adding and removing text/sgml comments when suitable
  options and tags are found.
- Put retrival date-stamps as comments in html files, to document the when
  and how of how this document was retrived.
- Example: If you're mirroring a site primarily to get to the papers, but
  the site has n versions of each paper: foo.ps.gz, foo.ps.Z, foo.dvi.gz
  foo.dvi.Z, foo.tar.gz, foo.zip and you only need one version.  Implement
  a way to get only one version of documents provided in multipele versions,
  something like multi axis preference list to get only the most attractive
  version of the doc.
- Logging of retrivals to file, need to change every print to a functioncall.
- Your suggestion here.

* TODO, http related
- Use Keep-alive.  Then we should probably stop using 30 second pauses
  between document retrivals.
- HTTP/1.1?  HTTP/1.1 servers should do keep-alive even with 1.0 requests.
- Separate quenes for each server, interleave requests.
- Authentication is only done if challenged now.  If a document in a
  directory needs authentication it is very likely that all other documents
  in that directory and subdirectories require authentication.

* If perl gets threads:
- Make the retrival and analysis engines separate threads, and have each
  one retrival thread pr. method/server/port and do paralell retrivals.
- This makes http/1.1 easier too.
