This is how you install w3mir on a Unix system:

(I don't know how to install w3mir on a win32 system.  Please e-mail
instructions if you know how)

INSTALLING PREREQUISITES:

The prerequisite is libwww-perl, and possebly MIME-Base64.  The w3mir
install procedure will check for their presence and complain if they
are not there, so you can skip to 'INSTALLING W3MIR' if you're unsure.

- Get libwww-perl from CPAN 
  (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/WWW/) or its homepage 
  (http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/)

- Unpack it:

    gzip -dc libwww-perl-*.tar.gz | tar xvBf -

- Install it:

    cd libwww-perl-*

  Are you going to install it in the standard perl place (you need to
  be the system administrator to do this)? If so:

    perl Makefile.PL

  If not

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/dir

  /some/dir could be ~ (as in your home directory).  This might
  produce some complaints.  A standard perl instalation will typically
  get messages about missing these modules:  IO::Socket, NET::FTP and
  MD5.  None of these are needed to run w3mir and so any error
  messages about these can be ignored.

    make
    make test      (robot/ua and local/http might fail, that's OK)
    make install

  Now libwww-perl should be installed and working :-)

- If you got a libwww-perl version later than 5.08 you also have to
  get the MIME-Base64 package
  (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/MIME/)

- Unpack it:

    gzip -dc MIME-Base64-*.tar.gz | tar xvBf -

- Install it:

    cd MIME-Base64-*

  Then, as above, either

    perl Makefile.PL

  or

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/dir

  Continue:

    make
    make test      (it should print 'All tests successful.')
    make install

  Now MIME-Base64 should be installed and working.

INSTALLING W3MIR:

- Get w3mir (http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/w3mir/)

- Unpack it:

     gzip -dc w3mir-*.tar.gz | tar xvBf -

- Install it:

     cd w3mir-*

  Are you going to install it in the standard perl place? (You need to
  be the system administrator to do this.) If so:

    perl Makefile.PL

  If not:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/dir

  /some/dir could be ~ (as in your home directory).

  then

     make
     make install

w3mir should now be installed correctly.  And if it's installed in
your path you can even run it.  If you use csh or tcsh you want to run
'rehash' before the shell will find it.
