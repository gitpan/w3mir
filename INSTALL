This is how you install w3mir on a Unix system. Please see the file
INSTALL.w32 for install instructions for win32 systems.

INSTALLING PREREQUISITES:

The prerequisites are the perl packages libwww-perl, and MIME-Base64.
The w3mir install procedure will check for their presence and complain
if they are not there, so if you are unsure what you have you might
skip this part for now.

- Get libwww-perl from CPAN 
  (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/WWW/) or its homepage 
  (http://www.sn.no/libwww-perl/)

- Unpack it:

    gzip -dc libwww-perl-*.tar.gz | tar xvBf -

- Install it:

    cd libwww-perl-*

  Are you going to install it in the standard perl place (you need to
  be the system administrator to do this)? If so:

    perl Makefile.PL

  If not (if you are a user):

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/dir

  /some/dir could be ~ (as in your home directory).

  This step might produce some complaints;  A standard perl
  installation will typically get messages about missing these
  modules: IO::Socket, NET::FTP and MD5.  None of these need be
  installed to run w3mir and so any error messages about these may
  safely be ignored.

    make
    make test      (robot/ua and local/http might fail, that's OK)
    make install

  Now libwww-perl should be installed and working.

- You also have to get the MIME-Base64 package
  (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/MIME/)

- Unpack it:

    gzip -dc MIME-Base64-*.tar.gz | tar xvBf -

- Install it:

    cd MIME-Base64-*

  Then, as above, either

    perl Makefile.PL

  or

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/dir

  Continue:

    make
    make test      (it should print 'All tests successful.')
    make install

  Now MIME-Base64 should be installed and working.

INSTALLING W3MIR:

- Get w3mir (http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/w3mir/)

- Unpack it:

     gzip -dc w3mir-*.tar.gz | tar xvBf -

- Install it:

     cd w3mir-*

  Are you going to install it in the standard perl place? (You
  probably need to be the system administrator to do this.) If so:

    perl Makefile.PL

  If not (if you're a user):

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/dir

  /some/dir could be ~ (as in your home directory).

  then

     make
     make install

w3mir should now be installed correctly.  And if it's installed in
your path you can even run it.  If you use csh or tcsh you want to run
'rehash' before the shell will find it.
