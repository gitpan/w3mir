<h1>W3MIR HOWTO</h1>

<p><b>Corresponding to w3mir version 1.0.2 and above</b>

<p>W3mir is an all purpose WWW copying and mirroring program.  Its
main focus is copying complete directory structures keeping your copy
browseable through a web server, or directly off a disk or CDROM if
you want.  W3mir will fix URLs that are redirected and everything else
that needs to be fixed to make your copy browseable.  But it also does
odd jobs, retrieving single documents, batch getting several documents
and more.  You may tell w3mir not to change anything in the retrieved
documents.  W3mir has been in development quite a long time so you
find options to do a lot of things needed when copying things off the
web.

<p>With w3mir you may copy the entire contents a web server.  Or just
a directory hierarchy, or several related hierarchies off as many
servers as you like.  They don't even have to be related.

<p>W3mir supports HTML4, and has partial support for CSS, Java,
ActiveX and Adobe Acrobat (PDF) files.  And it works on Win32
machines.

<p><b>Warning:</b> W3mir enables you to copy a lot of things off the
Web, but remember, the things you retrieve might be copyrighted and
the copy you make with w3mir might in fact be illegal to make and
posses.

<h2><a name="intro">README</a></h2>

<p>W3mir may be used in two, main, ways:

<ul>
  <li><p>To copy something random once.
  <li><p>To keep a local mirror of some remote site
</ul>

<p>To copy something random once there is a high likeliness you can
just start w3mir with some simple options and it will do the job you
want it to.  Providing that the remote site is not too complex and
your expectations of the copy aren't high :-) This is what wget, the
gnu w3 mirroring program, does and is good at.

<h3>Configuration file</h3>

<p>Once you want to keep a copy of a remote site up-to-date over time,
mirror something with server side image-maps, redirects or
authentication you have to write a configuration file for w3mir.  This
is what w3mir is good at, compared to wget.  Writing the file is not
hard, and there are two example files in the w3mir distribution.  It
will also be explained here.  The configuration file is typically
called <tt>.w3mirc</tt> (<tt>w3mir.ini</tt> on win32 machines), and
can be written with a simple text editor.  It is kept in the top
directory of the mirror, where w3mir will find it when it starts.
Please refer to the <a href="#contents">contents</a> for how to handle
a specific problem with a configuration file.

<h2>The answers:</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="copy">How do I copy a file?</a></h3>

<p>To copy the top page off www.starwars.com:

<p><tt>w3mir http://www.starwars.com/</tt>

<p><b>Note:</b> it is <em>important</em> that you give the trailing
slash for server names and directories.

<hr>

<h3><a name="recurse">How to I copy a directory hierarchy?</a></h3>

<p>To copy the entire stuff about episode I from www.starwars.com
which is stored in <tt>http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/</tt> (I don't
recommend this, it's quite a lot of data):

<p><tt>w3mir -r http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/</tt>

<p>The corresponding configuration file is simple:

<pre>
Options: recurse
URL: http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/
Fixup: run
</pre>

<p>The <tt>-r</tt> option makes w3mir recurse down from the starting
point.  It will only copy all the documents under
http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/ that it sees referenced from those
same documents.  W3mir will <em>not</em> retrieve documents from
http://www.starwars.com/ because it is considered to be 'over' the
starting point.

<p>The command-line will get you a copy that is definitely browseable
via a WEB server, and possibly browseable directly from a CDROM or
hard-disk.  To ensure that it is browseable from CDROM and disk you
need to use a configuration file with the <tt>Fixup: run</tt> line in.
It causes w3mir to edit anything that needs editing after the mirror
has completed, including fixing URLs that caused redirects.  The dirty
work is done by w3mirs helper program w3mfix.  The directive will
cause w3mfix to be run each time w3mir completes the mirror.

<p><b>Note:</b> it is <em>important</em> that you give the trailing
slash after the directory name.  Specifying
<tt>http://www.starwars.com/episode-i</tt> and
<tt>http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/</tt> is quite different in
w3mirs eyes.  In the former case episode-i is considered to be a
document within the / (top) directory of www.starwars.com and w3mir
will recurse from /, which is a lot more than you wanted.  In the
latter case w3mir understands that episode-i is a directory and will
consider that directory to be the staring point, which is what you
wanted.

<hr>

<h3><a name="resources">How do I copy the needed resource files from
another directory hierarchy?</a></h3>

<p>Some sites store their documents in one place, and puts their
banners, icons and such in a separate directory called
<tt>/images</tt>, <tt>/banners</tt>, <tt>/icons</tt>,
<tt>/resources</tt> or some such.  Unless you retrieve these as well as
the documents things will probably not be too colorful.  So, imagine
that the starwars site stored all the images in one holding directory
called <tt>/imagery</tt> and you want to copy all the stuff in it that
the episode-i pages need.  Then you do this:

<pre>
Options: recurse
URL: http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/ episode-i
Also: http://www.starwars.com/imagery/ imagery
Fixup: run
</pre>

<p>There are two changes here compared to the simpler file we started
with: There is an extra argument at the end of the URL directive.  It
tells w3mir to store everything gotten from
<tt>http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/</tt> in the subdirectory
<tt>episode-i</tt>.  The directory can be omitted, but I think its
neater this way.  Then the new directive 'Also:'.  It tells w3mir that
you also want whatever the documents under
<tt>http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/</tt> references under
<tt>http://www.starwars.com/imagery/</tt>.

<p><b>Note:</b> this will only get stuff that was used by the
documents under <tt>http://www.starwars.com/episode-i/</tt>, anything
stored under <tt>http://www.starwars.com/imagery/</tt> which is not
used will not be retrieved. If you want everything under
<tt>imagery</tt> to be retrived use the <tt>Also-quene:</tt>
directive.

<hr>

<h3><a name="ignore">How do I avoid copying files I don't want or copy
only files I want?</a></h3>

<p>To control what files w3mir copies you can use the
<tt>Ignore:</tt>, <tt>Fetch:</tt>, <tt>Ignore-RE:</tt> and
<tt>Fetch-RE:</tt> directives in the configuration file.  The embeded
references to any file you chose to ignore, i.e., not copy, will point
at the original site, <em>not</em> to the mirror.  This means that the
mirror user may still get ahold of the file from the original source
by simply clicking if she so desires.

<p>If a site contains huge .wav audio files that you are not
interested in you put

<pre>
Ignore: *.wav
</pre>

<p>in the configuration file.  You may ignore as many different
filename patterns as you want.  If you are mirroring a site you want
very few, specific files from, say all HTML (named
<em>something</em><tt>.html</tt>) and all Mpeg video files (named
<em>something</em><tt>.mpg</tt>) you can write this:

<pre>
Fetch: *.html
Fetch: *.mpg
Ignore: *
</pre>

<p>W3mir will test each filename against each Fetch/Ignore rule in
sequence.  A html file will match the first line and be fetched.  Any
mpg file will match the second line and be fetched.  All other files
will match the third line, and be ignored.  This last line is needed
because the default is to get any files which are not ignored.  By
arranging fetch and ignore rules carefully you may retrieve exactly
the filename patterns you want and not retrieve anything else.

<p>If you decide you also want all Mpeg Layer 3 audio files
(<em>something.</em><tt>mp3</tt>) from the site, after the mirror has
been established.  Then you add this:

<pre>
Fetch: *.mp3
</pre>

<p>as the third line, making the <tt>Ignore: *</tt> line the forth and
last.  Then you must fix all references to .mp3 files within the
mirror by running w3mfix thus:

<pre>
w3mfix -editref .mp3
</pre>

<p>which will edit all references to .mp3 files, pointing them the
right place, on your disk. Ditto when you remove a fetch rule, or add
or remove an ignore rule. See the answer about <a
href="#enlarge">enlarging and pruning</a> mirrors for more examples of
using <tt>w3mfix -editme ...</tt>

<p><b>Note:</b> when retrieving only a very limited set of files, as
in the example above, you <em>must</em> retrieve the html files,
because how else will w3mir find URLs of files to retrieve? Only html
files contain links to other files.

<p>Similarly, you may chose to not mirror whole branches of the
original site.  If you for example mirror my home-pages, and you decide
not to mirror the comics pages you can put

<pre>
Ignore: /ts/
</pre>

<p>or more precisely

<pre>
Ignore: http://www.ifi.uio.no/~janl/ts/
</pre>

<p>in the configuration file.  If you do this after having established
the mirror you use w3mfix to fix the references:

<pre>
w3mfix -editref /ts/
</pre>

<p><tt>Fetch:</tt> and <tt>Ignore:</tt> rules can only use a very
limited subset of the Unix wild-cards.  w3mir understands only '?',
'*', and '[a-z]' ranges.

<p><tt>Ignore-RE:</tt> and <tt>Fetch-RE:</tt> are the same as
<tt>Fetch:</tt> and <tt>Ignore:</tt> except that they give you access
to the full power of Regular Expressions to make rules for that to get
or not to get. They support perls superset of the normal Unix regular
expression syntax.  They must be completely specified, including the
prefixed m, a delimiter of your choice (except the paired delimiters:
parenthesis, brackets and braces), and any of the RE modifiers. I.e.,

<pre>
Ignore-RE: m/.gif$/i
</pre>

<p>or

<pre>
Ignore-RE: m~/.*/.*/.*/~
</pre>

<p>and so on.  "#" cannot be used as delimiter as it is the comment
character in the configuration file.

<p>There are some traps when using <tt>Ignore-RE</tt> and
<tt>Fetch-RE</tt>, please see their documentation in <tt>mandoc
w3mir</tt> for a more complete explanation.

<hr>

<h3><a name="depth">How do I limit how deep w3mir will recurse?</a></h3>

<p>W3mir has no explicit mechanism to limit the depth of recursion,
but the same result can be achieved with a simple <tt>Ignore</tt> rule:

<pre>
Ignore: /*/*/*/*/*/*/
</pre>

<p>This will ignore any URLs that contain at least 7 slashes ("/").
Note that a URL contains three slashes that does not have anything to
do with depth:

<pre>
http://www.ifi.uio.no/
</pre>

<p>so only the surplus slashes are used for depth in this match.  In the
example above the limit is 4 levels from the top.  The
<tt>Ignore:</tt> rule that is used to limit recursion depth must be
listed before any <tt>Fetch:</tt> rules to be effective.

<hr>

<h3><a name="memory">How do I limit w3mirs memory usage?</a></h3>

<p>In a mirror consisting of <em>many</em> files, such as a archive of
an active mailinglist w3mir will build a very large referer table, in
part for w3mir to use in the <tt>Referer:</tt> header and in part for
w3mfix to use in fixing references.

<p>If you disable both the <tt>Referer:</tt> header and don't use
w3mfix w3mir will not build a referer table.  You do this in the
configuration file:

<pre>
Disable-headers: referer
Fixup: off
</pre>

<p>Please note the potential problems of turning off fixup described
earlier in this howto.  There are normaly no problems associated with
simple sites, but if there are redirects fixup <em>is</em> needed for
a consistent mirror.

<hr>

<h3><a name="rm">How do I remove the files are no longer on the
original site from the mirror?</a></h3>

<p>Over time the site you mirror will add files, and quite possibly
remove files.  Or you might introduce new <tt>Ignore:</tt> rules after
establishing the mirror that reduces the files wanted in the mirror.

<p>By default w3mir will not delete such old files, some people might
want to keep the files even if they are removed from the original
site.  To remove the old/unwanted files you add 'remove' to the
<tt>Options:</tt> line.

<hr>

<h3><a name="multi">How do I copy files from multiple sites?</a></h3>

<p>In the answer to the previous question we see how to mirror several
related sites.  For example, say you want to mirror all my home-pages
into one mirror:

<pre>
Option: recurse
URL: http://www.math.uio.no/~janl/ math/janl
Also: http://www.math.uio.no/drift/personer/ math/drift
Also: http://www.ifi.uio.no/~janl/ ifi/janl
Also: http://www.mi.uib.no/~nicolai/ math-uib/nicolai
</pre>

<p>As in the previous example this will only get documents that are
referenced.  Any documents that are stored at these location but to
which w3mir finds no references will not be retrieved.  So this will
fail if the sites are not in any way related, or if you wanted
<em>everything</em> stored at each site.

<p>To mirror unrelated sites, or get it all you may specify that the
given URL should be considered a starting-point as well:

<pre>
Also-quene: http://www.math.uio.no/drift/personer/ math/drift
</pre>

<p>and, if you want to add an additional starting-point within a already
named site:

<pre>
Quene: http://www.math.uio.no/drift/personer/foo.html
</pre>

<p>Armed with that you should be able to get pretty much anything you
like.

<hr>

<h3><a name="alias">How do I copy files from one server with several
names?</a></h3>

<p>Simple, the same way you mirror several servers with different
names. The math department at University of Oslo has a web server
known under two names: math-www.uio.no and www.math.uio.no, and both
names are used in documents stored on it. To copy the whole server,
one time only, give these URL and Also lines:

<pre>
URL: http://www.math.uio.no/ .
Also: http://math-www.uio.no/ .
</pre>

<p>Note the period/dot (.) at the end of each line.  It means that
w3mir will store the files in the current directory, i.e. documents
from both servers will be stored in the same place.  But since w3mir
asks to only get documents that are newer than the ones it already has
any document gotten from the server under the www.math.uio.no name
will not be gotten from the math-www.uio.no name as well.  ... w3mir
will ask for the document, but the server will tell w3mir that its
copy is current and there will be no additional transfer of the
document.

<hr>

<h3><a name="enlarge">How do I enlarge or prune an established
mirror?</a></h3>

<p>This only works if you use a configuration file.

<p>If you want to add a site or directory to a mirror you simply add
the needed <tt>Also:</tt> or <tt>Also-Quene:</tt> to the configuration
file and then you run w3mfix manually, with the -editref option.  If,
you for example have established a mirror of my home-pages, but want to
add my wife's home-page you add this

<pre>
Also: http://www.ifi.uio.no/~annen/ ifi/annen
</pre>

<p>to the configuration shown earlier.  Then you run w3mfix, and you want
it to fix all URLs referencing her home-page, the distinguishing
characteristic is the name 'annen':

<pre>
w3mfix -editref annen
</pre>

<p>but 

<pre>
w3mirx -editref http://www.ifi.uio.no/~annen/
</pre>

<p>would work too, but it's a lot more to type.  This fixes all the
references to her home-page so that they point to the mirror instead of
the original pages.

<p>To prune (cut out something) a mirror you do the same.  Make the
change in the configuration file and run 'w3mfix -editme ...' to fix
the references to that which you removed.

<hr>

<h3><a name="cat">How do I 'cat' a file?</a></h3>

<p>W3mir will output the fetched document to its standard output
(normally your screen/window) if you specify the '-s' command line
option.  The corresponding configuration file directive is 

<pre>
File-Disposition: stdout
</pre>

<hr>

<h3><a name="list">How do I list URLs in a document?</a></h3>

<p>To list the URLs in http://www.math.uio.no/:

<pre>
w3mir -q -f -l http://www.math.uio.no/
</pre>

<p>The <tt>-q</tt> switch causes w3mir to produce no other output
which would disturb the URL listing.  The <tt>-f</tt> switch tells
w3mir to forget the document once it has been analyzed, i.e., not save
it on disk.  And finally, the <tt>-l</tt> switch makes w3mir list the
URLs in the document.  You may combine <tt>-l</tt> with <tt>-r</tt>
and you need not use it with <tt>-f</tt>.

<p>In the configuration file you put <tt>list</tt> on the
<tt>Options:</tt> line.

<hr>

<h3><a name="aborted">How to I restart a mirror process after stopping
it prematurely?</a></h3>

<p>You may just rerun the same command once more.  But that makes
w3mir request all the documents you have already once more to see if a
more recent version is available on the server.  You can save time by
using the <tt>-fs</tt> (Fetch Some) option.  This makes w3mir only
request documents it does not find on your disk.  E.g.:

<p><tt>w3mir -fs -r http://www.starwars.com/</tt>

<p>This is not something you would normally put in the configuration
file, but you can, by adding 'only-nonexistent' on the 'Options:' line.

<hr>

<h3><a name="robots">How do I disable robots.txt obedience?</a></h3>

<p>Normally w3mir will read and obey each sites robots.txt file,
because w3mir wants to be a nice tool. However robots.txt was designed
with something slightly different than the normal use of w3mir in
mind, so if you want w3mir to disregard the robot rules you can use
<tt>-drr</tt> (Disable Robot Rules) on the command-line, or the line

<pre>
Robot-Rules: off
</pre>

<p>in the configuration file.  The robot exclusion standard is
described in <a
href="http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/norobots.html">http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/norobots.htm</a>.

<hr>

<h3><a name="corrupt">How do I stop w3mir from corrupting binary
files?</a></h3>
     
<p>During the normal course of events w3mir converts the newline
format of fetched HTML documents to your systems native newline
format. On Unix a newline consists of a single ASCII LF character, on
Macintoshes it's a single ASCII CR character and on Dos/Windows it's a
ASCII CR/LF pair. W3mir understands all these and all HTML files are
saved in the format your operating system prefers.

<p>If, and this is very unlikely, a web server identifies a binary
file as HTML w3mir will very likely corrupt the file. If you discover
a file which is obviously ruined in the mirror, but is not ruined when
you view it on the original site do this:

<ol>

<li>Notify the webmaster on the original site that the file has the
wrong MIME type

<li>Use the <tt>-nnc</tt> (No Newline Conversion) option on the
command line, or

<pre>
Options: no-newline-conv
</pre>

in the configuration file.

<li>Remove the corrupt file(s).

<li>Run "<tt>w3mir -fs</tt>...", to fetch only the deleted file(s)
again.

</ol>

<hr>

<h3><a name="auth">How do I copy a site that wants user-name and
password?</a></h3>

<p>This can only be done with a configuration file.  Being able to
give this on the command-line would give the user-name and password away
to other users of the system, so the ability to give authentication
information that way has not been put in w3mir.

<p>In the configuration file you put:

<pre>
Auth-domain: */*
Auth-user: me
Auth-passwd: my-password
</pre>

<p>This will cause w3mir to give the user-name and password each time
the server asks.  There is no way to make w3mir give the user-name and
password each time no matter if the server asks or not.

<hr>

<h3><a name="mauth">How do I access a site that wants several
different user-names and passwords?</a></h3>

<p>If you have several user-names and passwords across
the server(s) that are copied you need a slightly more advanced
version of this that associates each user-name/password with a
authentication "domain".  "Domain" is a HTTP concept.  It is simply a
grouping of files and documents within a "realm".  One file or a whole
directory hierarchy can belong to a realm.  One server may have many
realms.  A user may have separate passwords for each realm, or the
same password for all the realms the user has access to.  A
combination of a server name, server port and a realm is called a
domain.

<pre>
Auth-domain: theserver:theport/therealm
Auth-user: me
Auth-passwd: my-password

Auth-domain: theserver:theport/otherrealm
Auth-user: other-me
Auth-password: other-password
</pre>

W3mir will tell you what the name of the realm is if it is unable to
authenticate itself with the server. You may also use '*' as the realm
name if you only copy documents from one realm on that server.

<hr>

<h3><a name="proxy">How do I use a proxy server?</a></h3>

<p>On some secured sites you have to access the Internet through proxy
servers to get out of the internal network.

<p>A proxy server has a host name, and a port you must use. On the
command line you simply specify <tt>-P proxy-host-name:proxy-port</tt>. In
the configuration file you put this:

<pre>
HTTP-Proxy: proxy-host-name:proxyport
</pre>

<p>The main advantage of working through proxy servers other than
security is that you take advantage of any caching the proxy server
which can speed up retrievals enormously.

<p>Another use of the proxy option is to "prime" the proxy servers
cache.  I.e. you can use w3mir to fetch the documents through the proxy
server to ensure that the documents are cached there later when you
want to read them with your browser.  If you also specify 

<pre>
File-Disposition: forget
</pre>

<p>it won't even use any space on your disk, w3mir will just process
the documents looking for URLs and then <em>not</em> save them.

<hr>

<h3><a name="pauth">How do I authenticate myself to a proxy
server?</a></h3>

<p>Some proxy servers demands a user-name and password to let you use
them.  W3mir does not support the domain concept in connection with
proxy authentication because the author cannot imagine that it will be
needed.  You need to put this in your configuration file:

<pre>
HTTP-Proxy-user: proxy-username
HTTP-Proxy-passwd: proxy-password
</pre>

<hr>

<h3><a name="proxytweak">How do I ensure that the proxy server
...?</a></h3>

<p>HTTP/1.0 proxy servers may be told to not use its current copy of
a document if you specify the <tt>-pflush</tt> command-line option.  Or 

<pre>
Proxy-Options: refresh
</pre>

<p>in the configuration file.  This is useful if the proxy has an old
copy of some document and does not realize that a newer version exists
on the origin site.  W3mir uses the HTTP/1.0 version of this command
by default.  You can force w3mir to use the HTTP/1.1 version by adding
<tt>no-pragma</tt> to the line.  If you do this it will not work at
all as you want unless the server knows the HTTP/1.1 protocol.


<p>HTTP/1.1 proxy servers can be manipulated in a few more ways.  The
configuration file <tt>Proxy-Options:</tt> directive also takes
<tt>revalidate</tt> and <tt>no-store</tt> options.  The former tells
the proxy server to check if there is any newer version available.
This is, in principle, more network friendly than the <tt>refresh</tt>
option since it will only cause a copy if there is a newer file
available.  The <tt>no-store</tt> option tells the proxy server to not
store the documents you transfer.  This might be useful if the
documents are 'sensitive' or something like that, but if the proxy
server does not understand HTTP/1.1 it will not obey this option, and
it might store the document anyway because the functionality is not
implemented, so you should not count on this to work.

<h3><a name="batchget">How do I batch get files with w3mir?</a></h3>

<p>Normally when fetching files w3mir will process each html (and PDF)
file to find URLs in them for further retrievals.  This is
time-consuming, and not always wanted.  Sometimes you simply want to
get a file, or more, and save it, untouched:

<pre>
w3mir -B http://www.starwars.com/ http://www.ifi.uio.no/~janl/
</pre>

<p>There is a companion switch for <tt>-B</tt>, namely <tt>-I</tt>, it
makes w3mir read URLs from its standard input, one pr. line.  Thus you
can use w3mir in a pipe to batch get several files whose URLs you find
in some way.  This is a stupid example:

<pre>
w3mir -q -l -f http://www.ifi.uio.no/ | w3mir -I -B
</pre>

<p><tt>-B</tt> may also be used with <tt>-r</tt>, but the only effect
it will have then is to save the html files unchanged on disk, because
to recurse w3mir <em>has</em> to examine all the html the documents
for URLs.

<p><b>Please note</b> that using <tt>-B</tt> combined with <tt>-r</tt>
for mirroring will probably lead to a unstable mirror, because w3mir
does not get a chance to manipulate the URLs in the documents as it
needs to be able to maintain a mirror later, and most important of
all, w3mir needs all html files to contain a &lt;HTML&gt; tag to be
able to recognize a HTML file as a HTML file. When running with the
<tt>-B</tt> switch w3mir will not ensure the presence of this and thus
we must rely on the original documents author to be nice. This is a
bad bet. In other words, <b>don't use <tt>-B</tt> for recursive
mirroring</b>, only for batch copying/mirroring of single documents.

<h3><a name="cgi">How do I handle CGI?</a></h3>

<p>There is no way w3mir can duplicate the process that happens on the
Web server when it comes to CGI.  For some CGI programs w3mir can
simply copy the output and store on disk.  For other CGI programs this
is not possible, and the only way out is to make w3mir not get the
involved files using Ignore rules in the configuration file.  These
will avoid a lot of cgi programs:

<pre>
Ignore: *.cgi
Ignore: *-cgi
</pre>

<p>You might have to add other/more rules for some sites if they have
other naming conventions or if it's simply impossible to tell from the
file-name if it's a CGI or not.

<p>When you add ignore rules this causes two things:

<ol>
<li><p>W3mir will not retrieve documents matching the rules
<li><p>W3mir will make all references to matching documents point to
  the site you mirrored from instead of pointing to a non-existent
  file in the mirror.
</ol>

<h3><a name="imap">How do I handle server side image-maps?</a></h3>

<p>Server side image-maps is yet another thing it's impossible for
w3mir to relate to.  w3mir simply cannot handle them.  Put ignore
rules in the configuration file:

<pre>
Ignore: *.map
</pre>

<p>W3mir has full support for client side image-maps though.

<hr>

<h3><a name="java">How do I handle Java and ActiveX?</a></h3>

<p>Java and Active X objects are are included in html pages with a
<tt>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;APPLET&gt;</tt> tag.  W3mir can
handle these on one condition: The CODEBASE attribute names the
directory where the program stores its resources (such as
subprograms, graphic files, sound, text, and so on) and w3mir must
have read access to this directory.  Otherwise w3mir is without hope,
it's impossible to extract the name of the resources the program needs
in any reliable way.

<p>HTML4 supports a attribute that enumerates the resources the
program needs, w3mir is not able to use this yet.

<hr>

<h3><a name="script">How do I handle java-script and other script
languages?</a></h3>

<p>W3mir does its best to pass scripts (java-script, perl-script,
etc...) embedded in the HTML undamaged.  It cannot, however, extract
any URLs the script generates and the browser would cause the document
to refer to or embed in a page. 

<p>It will however work if the script generates relative references
and there is some other way for w3mir to access the referenced file in
some other manner.  Or if the script generates absolute references and
the person browsing the mirror has access to the site named, then the
user will be able to browse the referenced documents via that other
server.

<hr>

<h3><a name="css">How to I handle the other things with 'partial
support'</a></h3>

<p>W3mir has partial support for CSS.  This means that
<tt>&lt;style&gt</tt> tags and the enclosed style data are passed
undamaged by w3mir.  W3mir will also retrieve the external CSSes named
in HTML documents.  But w3mir will <em>not</em> (yet) analyze the
CSSes data to find URLs of other resources (such as fonts) named in
these.

<p>W3mir also has partial support for Adobe Acrobat (PDF) files.  This
means that w3mir can extract URLs from PDF files, and get the named
documents if you want them.  But w3mir cannot edit those URLs so that
the PDF files point to the mirror instead of wherever on the original
site they were pointing.  If the PDF files contain absolute URLs they
will continue pointing to where they were pointing before.  However,
if the PDF files contain relative references things will work out.

<p>The reason that URLs in PDF files cannot be edited is that they are
binary and contain byte pointers.  If the URLs length is changed the
byte pointers will point to the wrong place in the document.  Writing
code to correct these pointers would be quite complex.  But if you
write it I will use it.

<h3><a name="anon">How do I keep my identity secret?</a></h3>

<p>The HTTP protocol has a header, <tt>User:</tt> which is recommended
to use by robots, such as w3mir.  Another way to track you is looking
at the 'Referer:' header w3mir gives in HTTP requests.  Both can be
disabled:

<pre>
Disable-headers: referer, user
</pre>

<p>If you in addition use a proxy server that many other users use
there is little probability you can be tracked (easily) by the server
you are copying things from.  You are however much easier to track
from the logs in the proxy server.  And a court order is quite likely
to get you tracked in spite of any precautions you take.  

<p>W3mir does not support cookies and thus you cannot be tracked with
the help of that mechanism.

<h3><a name="ns">How do I pretend that I'm using Netscape, Internet
Explorer or Lynx?</a></h3>

<p>Some web sites give you different documents when you ask for a
specific URL based on what browser you use, or even what OS you appear
to be using.  w3mir identifies itself with a string that looks like
this:

<p><tt>w3mir/<em>version</em>-<em>release-date</em></tt>

<p>Netscape identifies itself with strings that look something like
this:

<p><tt>Mozilla/3.01 (X11; I; Linux 2.0.30 i586)</tt>

<p>and Internet Explorer says it's something like this:

<p><tt>Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.02; Windows NT)</tt>

<p>and Lynx says something like this

<p><tt>Lynx/2.6  libwww-FM/2.14</tt>

<p>You can change w3mirs identification with <tt>-agent 'string'</tt>
on the command line.  In the configuration file you put

<pre>
Agent: Mozilla/3.01 (X11; I; Linux 2.0.30 i586)
</pre>

<p>to pretend w3mir is netscape 3.01.

<h3><a name="other">How do I do other things?</a></h3>

<p>This document is by no means a complete list of the things you can
do with w3mir.  The w3mir man page (<tt>man w3mir</tt> or <tt>perldoc
w3mir</tt> lists more things, and goes into more detail of how things
work so you can use the knowledge to do neat things.  There are
several things mentioned only in the man-page that helps you with
tricky multi-server mirroring, and gives you better control of what to
get and not to get and under what name to save it on disk.  And a
couple of other things...
